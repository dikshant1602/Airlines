Airline Booking System
This is a simple Airline Booking System that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner in web development, I wanted to create a project that covers the entire flight booking process, from selecting a flight to confirming the booking.

✈️ Project Overview
The website simulates an airline booking system where users can:
Search for flights
Select a flight
Enter passenger details
Choose payment options
Get a confirmation of the booking

🎨 Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the website
CSS: For styling and making it visually appealing
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and handling the booking process

📌 Features
✔️ User-friendly interface for booking flights
✔️ Dynamic flight selection process
✔️ Form validation for passenger details
✔️ Payment page simulation
✔️ Booking confirmation page
